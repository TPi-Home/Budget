# **Budgeteer Core**
This is the software I am building to automate my budget and expense spreadsheets. It currently handles expenses and a theme/layout I have used for my personal finance spreadsheets for years. <br>
## This spreadsheet was generated by this app:
![sheet_6_13_24](https://github.com/tpittman1011101/Budget/assets/45609608/39ef1d6d-307d-4965-a021-7b2f1c759bed)
## **How To Use This Software:**<br />
### Install dependencies:<br />
* .NET 8 SDK if not using a release build<br />
* Install Git (optional)<br />
* Powershell, CMD for Visual Studio, or Visual Studio (Linux use not currently supported, but it may still work)<br />
### Clone:<br />
```
git clone https://github.com/TPi-Home/Budget.git
cd Budget
```
### Build:<br />
**If you accidentally closed out of the CLI: Right click inside the Budget root directory from File Explorer, then click open with terminal.** <br />
Run to restore ClosedXML dependencies via Nuget:
```
dotnet restore
```
Then build:
```
dotnet build
```
Then run:
```
dotnet run
```
Alternatively, you can open the .SLN file and build/run from there. <br />
