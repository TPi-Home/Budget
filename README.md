Features Pending:<br />
*Simple graphical user interface<br />
*Adding tax and adjusting totals to account for that, further helping the user better itemize their expenses<br />
*A separate sheet for income<br />
*Different options for rent and mortgage<br />
*Options for Insurance<br />
*Options for different income types when the income sheet is more fleshed out<br />
*Options for savings<br />
