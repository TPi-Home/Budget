ADD TOTAL BEFORE MIN. DUE COLUMN

Option to open spreadsheet. Would probably need to check for an instance of Excel or LibreOffice.

dynamic form with scrolling to add additional labels and textboxes during data entry

better input validation where needed, and:
NEED TO ADD AN OPTION TO BREAK EARLY OR MODIFY NUMBER OF BILLS in data gathering
NEED TO BE ABLE TO DYNAMICALLY ADD/REMOVE COLUMNS, ENTER NEW FORMULAS WITH EASE, AND ADJUST BILL SPLITTING 

WS.addAfterLast OR Ws.addIncome
add after the last row lastrow +=3 
maybe a class for income that calls a helper function in data gathering

Change final due date columns and have split status be determined by a column of the sheet instead of ONLY user input on app

Fix alignment to make cells be more consistent
